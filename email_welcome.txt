Welcome to the Triple Crown for Heart ride!

The Triple Crown for Heart is a non-profit charity ride that raises money for the cardiac unit of the BC Children's Hospital Foundation. Although we have some corporate sponsors, we raise the bulk of donations through the fundraising efforts of riders such as you!

Your personal donation page can be found here:

Tax receipts will be sent for any donations over $20. This is a great opportunity to use your accomplishment to help some really great and deserving kids. 

See you on the mountains!
